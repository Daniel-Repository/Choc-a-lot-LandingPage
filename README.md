# Choc-a-lot Landing Page

https://krydan.github.io/Choc-a-lot-LandingPage/

Very basic landing page for a fictional chocolate treats provider.

Small project to practice my HTML & CSS! No JS at all yet.

## Potential additions for a rainy day:
- About, Store, and Contact pages.
- Mock pop up once user enters info and signs up for newsletter.
- Information on image in gallery once hovered.
- Additional media queries; need to make this look good on mobile.
- Footer
- Sticky nav bar
